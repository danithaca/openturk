Openturk.org is an open source, open data complement to Amazon Mechanical Turk for academic research. The site is based on <a href='http://drupal.org'>Drupal</a> plus a few contrib modules. This SVN repository is for the code deployed on the production http://openturk.org site. You can use the code to create your own openturk site.

The related Drupal modules can be found at:
  * http://drupal.org/project/mt_task (base module for all other openturk modules)
  * http://drupal.org/project/mt_karma (leaderboard, reputation)
  * http://drupal.org/project/mt_analysis (inter-rater reliability, final results from noisy input, etc)
